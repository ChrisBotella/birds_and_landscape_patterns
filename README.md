# birds_and_landscape_patterns

This code aims at evaluating the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to predict various French bird species abundances locally from a matrix of small patch forest percentage cover. 

Envisioned questions around this are : (i) How the abundances of bird species is related to the forest cover spatial patterns that can't be captured by standard statistical models or hand crafted landscape features? (ii) More precisely, what kind of spatial patterns are at play? (iii) Which spatial pattern enable to predict which species?

## Learn CNN model
To learn the CNN model on the data, run the script called **test_CNN_model.R**. It includes the installation of the **R-mxnet** deep learning package and requires libraries **raster** and **ggplot2**.  

Also, the local directory variable named **dataDir** must be changed. The directory must initially contain the data file **data_birds_landscape_CNN.RData**. Then, in this directory will be saved the following files, generated by this script: 
- The reshaped data (Xarray and Yarray)
- The model symbolic architecture (test_0-symbol.json)
- The model parameters at each epoch of the lerning process (test_0-XXX.params) 
- The loss metrics across epochs in a CSV file (test_0_losses.csv)
